A note to maintainers:

To add a dependency to the client installation one has to perform the following steps:

1. Install the required vendor dependencies. This can be done using `composer install` in the root of the project.
2. Modify the `composer.json` file or use the command line `composer require .../...`.
3. Package the vendor dependencies as a web phar archive: `box build -v` or `php vendor/kherge/box/bin/box build -v` (takes a lot of time on slow disk machines).
4. Now an updated `vendor.phar` is placed in the root of the repository, which is included by the autoloader.

After packing, the vendor directory is no longer needed. Thus, using `composer` is no longer necessary for deployment.

Considerations:

- Not all Laravel packages are correctly using relative paths when including files. These may break by packing them.
- It is always possible to leave out the composer autogenerated mappings, and use `$loader->addPsr4()` methods
  to manually add class loader folders. This is especially essential for loading non-packed files.
